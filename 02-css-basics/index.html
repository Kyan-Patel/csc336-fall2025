    <h2>Team History</h2>
  
  <h3>Early Years (1946-1971)</h3>
  <p>The Golden State Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, named after the team that played in the American Basketball League in the 1920s. The franchise won its first NBA championship in 1947, led by Joe Fulks, one of basketball's early scoring pioneers. In 1962, the team relocated to San Francisco and became the San Francisco Warriors, playing at the Cow Palace and later the Fillmore Auditorium.</p>
  
  <h3>The Move to Golden State (1971-1980s)</h3>
  <p>In 1971, the team moved across the bay to Oakland and adopted the "Golden State" name to represent the entire state of California. The Warriors captured their second championship in 1975, led by Rick Barry and coach Al Attles, in a stunning upset over the heavily favored Washington Bullets. This championship team was known for its fast-paced, entertaining style of play.</p>
  
  <h3>Struggles and Rebuilding (1980s-2000s)</h3>
  <p>The franchise endured several decades of mediocrity, with only occasional playoff appearances. Notable players during this era included Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway, and Mitch Richmond, known as "Run TMC" for their high-scoring, up-tempo style in the early 1990s. The team moved to a new arena in San Francisco in 1996 but continued to struggle with consistency.</p>
  
  <h3>The Dub Dynasty (2009-Present)</h3>
  <p>The Warriors' transformation began with the drafting of Stephen Curry in 2009 and the hiring of Steve Kerr as head coach in 2014. The team developed a revolutionary style of play centered around three-point shooting and ball movement. Key players included Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and later Kevin Durant (2016-2019).</p>
  
  <h4>Championship Success</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2015:</strong> First championship in 40 years, defeating Cleveland Cavaliers</li>
    <li><strong>2017:</strong> Dominant championship, going 16-1 in the playoffs</li>
    <li><strong>2018:</strong> Back-to-back championship, defeating Cleveland again</li>
    <li><strong>2022:</strong> Fourth championship in eight years, defeating Boston Celtics</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
  <p>The Warriors revolutionized modern basketball with their "small ball" lineup and emphasis on three-point shooting. They set numerous records, including the 2015-16 season's 73 regular season wins (breaking the Chicago Bulls' record). Stephen Curry became the face of the franchise and is widely credited with changing how basketball is played at all levels.</p>
  
  <p>The team moved to the Chase Center in San Francisco in 2019, marking their return to the city after nearly 50 years in Oakland. Today, the Warriors are considered one of the most successful and influential franchises in NBA history.</p>
